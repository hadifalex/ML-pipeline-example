## 🧠 L2D Final Project

The final part of the course comprises a project that applies code and concepts across all parts of the L2D course, to a given dataset.

### 📈 Data Options:

You have three main options for approaching this project. Either:

1. You can use our sample datasets, included in this repository, in the [data](/data/) folder.
2. You can use your own data, if you deem it suitable to demonstrate the analyses required by the [Final Project](Final_Project_Template.ipynb).
3. You can use a public dataset of your choosing, that you deem suitable.

**Note**: If you opt for options 2 or 3, and are unsure regarding the suitability of your data, please [contact us](mailto:admin@learntodiscover.ai), and we will do our best to advise you. We will also require access to your data, so please do not use data that are confidential. If your data are too large (more than 100mb) to upload to this GitHub repository, you will be responsible for hosting them online in a way that we can access them. 

### Final Project Rundown Lecture:

There will be a lecture held on [Thursday December 18th at 14:00 GMT, on Zoom](https://ucl.zoom.us/j/93522532680), in which we will give you a run-down of how the Project operates, and offer an opportunity for you to ask any questions that you might have. The recording will be made available, and added to the [Machine Learning Lectures playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTRx90_S7dFvCizj4JHXa69dtc0Ke1bd5).

### 🎁 Provided Datasets:

If you opt for the first option, our available data is stored in: [data](/data/). You can either make use of a Codespace to do the project, or you can download this, if you wish to code locally using a desktop IDE of your choice. To do the latter, click the green 'code' button, and then 'Download Zip'. There should be **five** available data files. Please keep data in the same folder as your Jupyter Notebook, so that we can easily

**Note:** The diabetes dataset can be imported directly from scikit-learn, as per [these instructions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html). 

### 🏁 Completing your Final Project:

Please take a moment to thoroughly look through the contents of this GitHub repository. We have provided you with a [**Final Project Template**](Final_Project_Template.ipynb), that you should fill out and submit, as you would an ordinary assignment, by committing and synchronising your changes back to your GitHub repository.

The template contains instructions, guidelines, and various checkpoints that you should aim to satisfy, in order to complete the Project to the fullest extent.

### 📁 Example, Model Project:

For one of our provided sample datasets (EEG with annotated eye state) you can refer to our example [**model project**](Resources/model_project_eeg.ipynb), to understand what is required and expected.

### 💡 Tips:

There is no 'right answer' for a successful Final Project. We are essentially just looking to assess that you have understood the breadth of topics covered on the course, with the Project intending to help you think about how to transfer these methods and techniques, in combination, to a real-world example. Please feel free to approach this with your own crtical thinking, providing written explanation in your Project notebook, in the form of well-commented code, and text explanation in markdown cells, if and when appropriate. 

### 📩 Project Submission and Deadline:

As aforementioned, please approach submission as you would with a regular L2D assignment - namely by working on the [**Final Project Template**](Final_Project_Template.ipynb) notebook (either in a Codespace or IDE of your choice), and committing changes, and synchronising or pushing these back to this repository. Please add a sensible commit message (such as: "Final Project submitted." or simialr), when submitting your notebook. 

The deadline for this project is: **January 31st, 2026**. If you are struggling to meet this deadline, for any reason, please contact us, and let us know, so we can make arrangements.

### 🎉 L2D Completion and Certification:

If you have done the full L2D course, in order to obtain the final Certificate of Completion, you will need to complete at least:

- **Three** out of four Basic Python assignments, to the level of pass, or above.
- **Three** out of four Data Handling assignments, to the level of pass, or above.
- **Five** out of six Machine Learning assignments, to the level of pass, or above.
- The **L2D Final Project** to the level of pass, or above.

As with assignments, Projects awarded a revise will be recorded as such, until you have submitted a revision to the level of a pass, or above.

### ⛑️ Support:

If you have any questions, we are available to help you, as per the usual support avenues. You can use the [discussion forum](https://github.com/L2D-Summer2025-ML/Discussions/discussions), contact us by [email](mailto:admin@learntodiscover.ai) or book in a 1-to-1 support call _via_ the usual mechanisms.

We wish you all the best with your project, and hope you have enjoyed the course. We have thoroughly enjoyed working with you, and hope you have found transferrable skills and benefit in training with L2D.

With all our best wishes,

The L2D Team
